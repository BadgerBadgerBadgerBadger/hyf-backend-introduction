# Backend Starter

## Getting Started

- `npm install`
- **run the server**
  - `npm run dev` - uses `nodemon` to restart the server each time you save a change
  - `npm run start` - does not restart each time you save a change
- **code checks**
  - `npm run format`
  - `npm run lint`
- **building documentation**
  - `npm run document`

## Using the app

- **from postman**
  - `http://localhost:xxxx/api` - the main entry point to the API
  - `http://localhost:xxxx/api/hello` - the "hello world" route that comes with this repo
- **from the browser**
  - `http://localhost:xxxx/` - serves `/client/index.html`, useful for practicing fetching from your API
  - you can also use the other routes, but it will be less helpful than in Postman
